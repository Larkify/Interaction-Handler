    <br />

  </p>

> **NOTE:** This is a little outdated, and the code quality isn't so good. However, it should still work!
 
## 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 
- Add `interactionEvent.js.js` to a folder within your root directory.
- Add the snippet of code (`ready-event-snippet.js`) to your ready event.
- Create a folder called "interactions" and add all of your code there for slash commands. 

## 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝘂𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲
*You don't have to have your like this, but it's how I've set it up in the code so if you wish to edit it, you can :D*
```
root/
├─ index.js
|
├─ interactions/
│  ├─ ping.js
│  ├─ foobar.js
|
├─ events/
│  ├─ ready.js
|  ├─ interactionEvent.js

```

## 𝗘𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻
1. I've added the module.export example in the example folder that you need in **all** of your slash command files (`interactions/`) in order for them to register.
